							////////////////Word Duels////////////////

Word Duels is a game designed by Konrad Jasman and Isaac Morton for the 2021 UVEC Engineering Competition - Programming event. 

We hope to develop this application into a supplement for early-stage computer education, to build vocabulary and improve keyboard familiarity 
in both children and seniors. In addition, we are aware of the benefits of vocabulary-based memory activities, such as crossword puzzles and scrabble,
in preventing alzheimers and hope our program has similar benefits; pending research. 

This is the source distribution for Word Duels.

Recent changes can be found in "CHANGELOG". Bugs and issues can be found in "ISSUES". Documentation is found in "LOG". "FEATURES" contains details relevant to creation and maintenance of the software, not intended for users. "PLAYGUIDE" contains detailed game instructions.
