PREMISE
The premise of the game is as follows: two players flip a virtual to determine who goes first. The first player picks a word, and if the word is within the given 
dictionary, it will be sent to the second player - who then selects a word that begins with the same letter as the last one ended with. 
If the word PLAYER2 enters is in the dictionary, PLAYER1 must now find a word that begins with the letter that PLAYER1's word ended with.

SCORING
Each round can earn a maxiumum of 10 points. The user loses one point per second, up to a maximum of 10. A user can not earn less than 0 points.
If a user enters a word already used in the duel, they will recieve a pentaly. In quick play, the penalty is an automatic loss.
This can be modified in cusotm to instead deduct points, or not punish the user. 


EXAMPLE ROUND
PLAYER1 enters "apple", PLAYER2 must pick a word that begins with letter "e". PLAYER2 enters "electric". Now, PLAYER1 must find a word beginning with "c".
